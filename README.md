# WikiClimb Frontend Prototype

A flutter project used to prototype screens for the WikiClimb frontend.

## Functionality

This project will compile and run on most platforms but the functionality is just mocked. The application should not have any external dependencies or connect to any services.

## Screen prototypes

1. **HomeScreen** - not a prototype, it displays a clickable list of the other screens and allows navigating between them.

## Testing

When contributing screen mock-ups consider adding tests to make sure that, at the very least, the screens are created and work as expected.
